        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Pantharee Nareekham, I'm a fourth-year digital media Engineering student at Khon Kaen University</p>
        <p>Pursuing digital media engineering provided me with knowledge of media design, 
            whether it was a short film or a music video, as well as interaction design for applications or websites. 
            It caught my interest in learning more about the company's processes in order to expand my knowledge and skills in this field.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the key projects I've worked on during my studies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="project-list"><strong>BizNote: Manage your order (2024)</strong>
                <br/>BizNote is an application that covers all aspects of shop administration, 
                    including managing orders and stocks, in a single application.  
                    This application was created using Firebase as the database with Flutter and Dart.
            </li>
            <li class="project-list"><strong>Redesign Goodreads Website (2024)</strong>
                <br/>Goodreads is a website where people can find and review the book and share it with others in the community.  
                In this project, I learned how to communicate with users by doing 
                UX research from interviews, setting usability goals, user experience goals, information architecture, and interaction design.

        <article><h3>The Challenge to Create the Project in Higher Education Innovation Awards 2024</h3>
        <p>July 10, 2025</p>
            <p>Based on the creation of Project The Game for people who have Alzheimer’s disease 
            or are at risk of getting the disease by User-Generated Content for the competition, 
            our original goal was to create an application with Flutter and Unity, 
            where Flutter is used for app development and Unity is utilized for game development.</p>  
            <p>Unfortunately, in the few week before the competition, we had to switch to Flutter development 
            because Unity only allows for static apps, which did not fit the idea of our app.</p>
            <p>Despite the fact that many things did not go as planned, we were able to fully construct this application.  
            Developing this project showed me that we should thoroughly test the functions of the program before using it.</p>
